# Economic analyses of respiratory tract infection diagnostics: a systematic review 

This GitHub repository contains code to create the tables as presented in the manuscript mentioned above.

## Use of the script

To get started you will need a recent version of R. The code uses the *checkpoint* package to make the code better reproducible and portable. Upon running the table_create.R script, a folder (.checkpoint) will be created in the working directory containing the required packages. The script will then create the tables and save them in the *output* folder.
