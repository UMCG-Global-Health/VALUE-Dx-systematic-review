If antibiotics can be stopped earlier, when quantitative cultures are negative and the clinical context is favorable, then the benefit of diagnostic testing strategies will be greater. Sensitivity analysis of antibiotic stopping rules was therefore used to model the wide spectrum of clinical practice. Even if a full course of therapy was always given in the setting of negative culture results (conservative stopping rule), the benefits of diagnostic testing outweighed the costs, provided that two or more antibiotics were used initially; Another limitation of this model is the uncertainty in the relationship between the number of antibiotics used and probability of effective coverage.

However, if any drug were even 20% more effective than the others in reducing the duration of illness, it would usually be the drug of choice.

treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors returned patients
to normal activity 1–2 days sooner than did placebo, no study reported return to work. Because cost-effectiveness of the neuraminidase inhibitors depends on the economic impact of lost work time, future influenza studies should report the effect of the drugs on subjects’ return to work. Amantadine, however, is cost-effective even for nonworking adults. Other factors, such as the incidence of side effects or whether these drugs prevent influenza complications, did not affect the decision for healthy adults, unless the side effects were so severe that they delayed return to work.

Bedside Rapid Flu Test and Zanamivir Prescription in Healthy Working Adults,Schwarzinger,2003,respiratory tract infection,To estimate the economic effects of implementing RFT and zanamivir among unvaccinated healthy working adults who consult within 2 days of the onset of influenza-like symptoms.,"Using a decision-analysis model, our primary objective was to estimate the costs related to the implementation of RFT and neuraminidase inhibitors during influenza epidemics and to compare them with the savings from the secondary infectious complications averted and the societal benefits of productivity gains. Our main economic analysis was limited to zanamivir, i.e. the only neuraminidase inhibitor for which published estimates for key parameters of savings have been provided; however, strategies involving oseltamivir
were also discussed. We also looked for the best strategy for use at times when the proportion of influenza infections in patients with influenza-like
symptoms varied, during the peri-influenza season
(before and after epidemic periods).",Testing,TRUE,TRUE,healthy working adults younger than 65 years of age who consult within 2 days of the onset of influenza-like symptoms,"Not stated, but most likely primary care",Societal perspective,RFT with zanamivir; systematic zanamivir; no zanamivir,zanamivir; antibacterial therapy,Duration of influenza-like illness,FALSE,NA,NA,Duration of illness,Synthesis-based estimates,TRUE,TRUE,20.0,zanamivir: $44.40,1999.0,use of the Consumer Price Index,Decision tree,FALSE,"We constructed a decision tree (figure 1) to compare three strategies for the management of healthy working adults younger than 65 years of age who consult within 2 days of the onset of influenza-like symptoms (defined as having fever [>37.8°C] or feverishness and at least two symptoms vvvof myalgia, cough, headache or sore throat).

The RFT with zanamivir strategy aims to maximise the proportion of influenza-positive patients receiving zanamivir. We assumed that zanamivir is prescribed after a positive test and, conversely, that it is not prescribed after a negative test. The predictive values of RFT depend on the proportion of influenza-positive patients as well as the sensitivity and specificity of RFT. In the systematic
zanamivir strategy, all patients with influenza-like symptoms receive zanamivir, and RFT is accordingly irrelevant. The reference option is the no zanamivir strategy, when physicians prescribe neither zanamivir nor RFT. Secondary infectious complications (implying follow-up visits and antibacterial use) and over-the-counter (OTC)medication were assumed to depend on both influenza
infection and zanamivir prescription (see node A of figure 1).",TRUE,FALSE,NA,RFT with zanamivir: -14.40 for 0.65 averted influenza days; systematic zanamivir: -29.80 (per patient) for 0.81 averted influenza days,"costs or savings /patient, averted influenza days /patient","Table of DSA, Sensitivity analysis graph (with one parameter varied)","Ranges that the authors deemed plausible, and are varying for many input parameters",No PSA,NA,"During influenza epidemics, when unvaccinated healthy working adults consult within 2 days of the onset of influenza-like symptoms, systematic zanamivir prescription without rapid influenza test is a dominant strategy from a societal perspective. Systematic zanamivir provided the best health outcome (0.81 influenza days averted) and minimised societal costs (saved $US29.80 per person) compared with no zanamivir. Under the standard model, systematic zanamivir yielded the greatest societal savings when the proportion of influenzapositive patients was above 39%, and no zanamivir achieved the greatest savings at lower levels. RFT with a conditional zanamivir prescription was sometimes best in the peri-epidemic periods when the proportion of influenza-positive patients ranged closely around 40%; this depended, however, on the sensitivity, specificity, and price of the RFT.

When restricting to the healthcare payer perspective, the medical costs associated with no zanamivir were $US88.70 per patient consulting with
influenza-like illness, and increased up to 41% with systematic zanamivir and 44% with RFT and conditional zanamivir.

Systematic zanamivir during influenza epidemics prevented secondary infectious complications and thus reduced antibacterial use and follow-up
visits with savings of $US6.00 per person.","We did not consider the potential reduction in hospitalisations related to a respiratory event that led to antibacterial prescription. If the high costs of hospitalisation were averted, then a systematic zanamivir prescription would result in more savings.We also did not consider the unnecessary antibacterials prescribed to meet the expectations of patients with influenza-like symptoms. Transforming these prescriptions for antibacterials to prescriptions for
zanamivir should contribute to an overall decrease in antibacterial use, an important public health goal if we are to reduce the emergence and spread of
antibacterial-resistant bacteria.

The results of our study are limited to unvaccinated healthy persons younger than 65 years of age. Indeed, the proportion of influenza-positive patients is likely to depend on the vaccination status of patients. Since vaccine efficacy is approximately 80% when the antigenic match between vaccine and circulating viruses is close, the proportion of influenza-positive infections among
vaccinated patients with influenza-like symptoms may vary between 8–16% during influenza epidemics (the proportion of influenza infections among
unvaccinated patients multiplied by 1–vaccine efficacy). The no zanamivir strategy would therefore be more cost saving than the RFT with zanamivir
strategy for vaccinated healthy working adults. Major health outcomes assessed in populations at high risk of influenza-related complications were inapplicable to our population since influenza did not cause a significant excess of deaths among healthy people younger than 65 years of age (0.02 per 10 000 person-months [95% CI: –0.01–0.05]), nor a significant increase of the number of annual
influenza-related hospitalisations at low risk (i.e., maximum 11 hospitalisations per 10 000 persons).

Effectiveness was assessed by the number of influenza days averted rather than the recommended quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) approach. These two measures are linked, however, since our health outcome depended on morbidity
only, and the direction of a cost-effectiveness analysis would not change with the QALY approach. Moreover, QALYs were constructed to assess
the loss of quality of life in chronic diseases; extending their use to short-term non-fatal diseases requires further research.

We adopted a societal approach as recommended by the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. The measurement of productivity
gains (or losses) remains controversial, however, and involved two decisions related to the costing method and the measurement of daily earnings lost. Our costing method, justified by the current full employment situation in the US in 1999, was based on the human capital approach and approximated productivity gains by multiplying additional work days by their related median earnings.[The friction-cost method, which takes into account originally that persons with long-term diseases are definitively replaced at work, might also apply, since the short duration of influenzarelated absenteeism might either be compensated for locally in up to 60% of cases[ or permit patients tomake up theirmissed work on their return.

Our model did not include two outcomes that are important in deciding whether systematic neuraminidase inhibitor prescription should be recommended
during influenza epidemics: adverse events and a future reduction in neuraminidase inhibitor efficacy related to the development of neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant influenza viruses. Patients receiving zanamivir and placebo reported similar frequencies of adverse events (less than 5%). Consequently, we did not include adverse effects in our cost-benefit analysis of zanamivir prescription. Since the development of influenza viruses resistant to zanamivir in influenza-positive patients is very low or not observed in immunocompetent
adults in vivo, we found that taking into account resistance to zanamivir in the costbenefit model is still speculative.

Finally, our results were dependent on (i) the implementation of a clinical case definition of influenza-like illness, i.e. having fever (>37.8°C) or feverishness and at least two symptoms of myalgia, cough, headache or sore throat, and (ii) the identification of influenza epidemics by collective surveillance systems. Firstly, the proportion of patients with influenza-like illness seeking medical advice was estimated to be 50% in a recent national prospective survey, and it correlated strongly with the severity of symptoms, i.e. when patients could benefit the most from neuraminidase inhibitors. The availability of neuraminidase inhibitors may
increase the proportion of patients with influenza-like illness seeking medical advice and potentially receiving neuraminidase inhibitor therapy within

This would increase the net societal benefit by increasing the number of appropriately treated patients, under the assumption that the proportion of influenza-positive infections is similar between patients currently seeking medical advice and others not seeking advice. However, less restriction in the clinical case definition during influenza epidemics would decrease its specificity and the proportion of identified influenza positive patients, and it may compromise the societal benefit associated with systematic neuraminidase inhibitors. Secondly, influenza surveillance systems provide timely information on the beginning of influenza epidemics even if the end of the epidemic may be more blurred. This emphasises that bedside rapid flu tests should not substitute the necessary collection of clinical specimens for viral culture needed by influenza surveillance information systems.

If so, should treatment be based on clinical diagnosis or directed by rapid testing? Should standard therapy include oseltamivir

To answer these questions, we constructed a decision analytic model to determine the cost-effectiveness of empirical vs test-guided antiviral therapy compared with no antiviral therapy for children presenting with symptoms of influenza.","Testing, clinical diagnosis",TRUE,TRUE,"Healthy children at ages 2, 7 and 15 years",Primary care,Societal perspective,Quickvue; ZstatFlu,Amantadine; oseltamivir; amoxicillin,lifetime,FALSE,NA,NA,"QALYs, Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE)",Synthesis-based estimates,FALSE,TRUE,QuickVue: 15; ZstatFlu: 14.5,Amantadine: 6.40-8.59 (depending on age); oseltamivir: 39.85-64.54; amoxicillin: 8.12-21.19,2003.0,Consumer Price Index (medical component),Decision tree,TRUE,"We constructed a simple decision tree by means of a standard computer program (Decision Maker 7.07; Pratt Medical Group, Boston, Mass) to compare the following strategies: (1) no antiviral therapy, (2) empirical treatment with either amantadine or oseltamivir, and (3) rapid office testing followed by treatment with amantadine or oseltamivir. The outcome measures were cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved. We considered healthy children at ages 2, 7, and 15 years as representative of toddlers, children, and adolescents. Baseline differences for these age groups include the probability of hospitalization, the cost of weight-based medication, the cost of syrup
vs pills, and the need for an adult caretaker to miss work on the final day of illness. In addition, vaccination is now recommended for all children aged 6 to 23 months. Because this recommendation is new, we performed all analyses twice, once for vaccinated children and again for unvaccinated ones.",TRUE,FALSE,NA (they go into detail in the discussion though),$800 - $1800,costs or savings /QALY,"Deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA), Sensitivity analysis graph (with one parameter varied), Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA)",Proportion influenza that is type B,1000.0,"Age groups, differences in hospitalization, medication costs, caretaker missing work","This cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrates that during local influenza outbreaks, children with symptoms of influenzalike illness benefit from antiviral therapy if it is initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset. At the same time, antiviral therapy saves money if parents return to work sooner. In that case, there is no trade-off between cost and effectiveness. When parents do not miss
work, antiviral therapy still improves quality-adjusted life expectancy, but at a monetary cost. The costeffectiveness of antiviral therapy, especially with amantadine, compares favorably with that of other recommended interventions such as vaccinations against varicella,39 pneumococcal meningitis,40 and hepatitis B. The preferred antiviral drug depends almost entirely on the proportion of influenza cases caused by type B influenza. Oseltamivir is much more expensive than amantadine, but little is known about their relative efficacy
against influenza A infection, because there are no comparative trials.WheninfluenzaApredominates, both drugs appear equally effective, but amantadine may be better tolerated and is less expensive. Because amantadine is not active against influenza B, however, oseltamivir will be more effective when influenza B is prevalent.","We did not include development of viral resistance in our model, because the implications of resistance are not well understood. Resistance to oseltamivir
is uncommon, but resistant viruses emerge rapidly during amantadine therapy and can be transmitted in a closed environment such as a nursing home. Resistant viruses are not more virulent and have not caused epidemics.
Nevertheless, if treatment were to result in widespread amantadine resistance, amantadine would no longer be useful for prophylaxis or treatment. Unlike antibiotics, antivirals cannot induce resistance in individuals who are not currently infected with the virus. As a result, empirical treatment, which involves treating some patients without influenza, is no more likely to induce resistance than test-directed therapy. If widespread use of short-course therapy with amantadine is adopted, the transmission of resistant viruses should be monitored, and a large clinical trial would be welcome.

Our model neglected some potential benefits of antiviral therapy. If antiviral therapy were to reduce hospitalizations, it could be cost-saving for high-risk children at any age. However, the only trial of oseltamivir for asthmatic children
did not show a significant decrease in duration of illness, and it has not been published. Antivirals might also decrease transmission of influenza to other household members, especially unvaccinated infants or the elderly. Even a small decrease in transmission would have large economic and health implications. On the basis of a pooled analysis, Couch et al reported that antiviral therapy resulted in a 30% reduction in transmission compared with placebo, but these results have never been published. Two randomized trials compared postexposure prophylaxis of households with oseltamivir. In one trial, the index case received no antiviral therapy, and 21% of individual contacts receiving placebo developed influenza. In the other, the index case also received antiviral therapy, and only 13% of contacts receiving placebo developed influenza (a 38%
reduction). A prospective trial is needed to see whether treatment of the index case decreases spread. Our analysis may overestimate the benefit of therapy
for patients with influenza B, which may be milder than influenza A. On the basis of a small study sample, we assumed that oseltamivir would be equally effective against influenza A and B. If oseltamivir is less effective against influenza B than A, then oseltamivir will be less costeffective as well.","some practitioners will be uncomfortable
prescribing empirical therapy. Such caution avoids unnecessary
adverse effects but leads to undertreatment, even if rapid testing is used.  Because the rate of adverse effects from oseltamivir and the false-negative rate for QuickVue are identical, a child is more likely to be helped than harmed by empirical oseltamivir whenever the probability of influenza is greater than 50%.","Yes,",TRUE,Testing not cost-effective - empirical treatment is cost-effective,50000.0,NA,"Resistance, see above",NA,FALSE,Rothberg 2003 (no reference however),Influenza A and B,United States,Pratt Medical Decision maker,US dollars,"Cost Effectiveness analysis, Cost Utility Analysis",Cost Utility Analysis,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,", clinical diagnosis",influenza,TRUE,NA,NA,Lifetime horizon,TRUE,FALSE,Influenza,decision tree model,lifetime,Primary care,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Societal perspective,QALY,Pratt Medical Decision maker,Not cost-effective,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,High income,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In order to estimate the number of QALYs because of reduced antibiotic resistance an extensive model should be available which builds a bridge between antibiotic resistance in society and the potential lives lost or saved. To the best of our knowledge, such models are not available at present and their development is out of the scope of this research project. At this moment the percentage decrease in prescriptions is the nearest parameter that tell us a litte bit about the future potential gains of a more adequate prescription of antibiotics. This is the reason that we can not translate this economic study into cost per QALY.
We were able to calculate incremental incremental net benefit (INB) curves, weighting effects (reduction in antibiotic prescribing) by defining NMB using the maximum willingness to pay for an effect, and subtracting the cost difference. Interpretation for the NMB is unambiguous, unlike the negative ICER. The NMB can easily be extended to more than two treatments. When comparing several treatments, the NMB is properly ordered. That is, a treatment with the largest NMB is considered the most cost-effective. This unique approach also allowed us to model scenarios of implementation to inform policy makers and physicians on cost-effectiveness of interventions with GP preference as a variable.
We present findings from a health care perspective. Patients in all groups were off work for a similar mean duration. We have no indication that our intervention effected production loss or clinical recovery. Therefore, we chose to exclude these costs from the analysis instead of presenting them from the societal perspective. Another justification for this decision is the magnitude of these production loss costs compared with the small total mean management cost per patient in this trial, which was approximately €30– 40. These costs of a cough-related illness episode are similar to findings from a British acute cough study. Hence, the costs we included in our final analysis are from a health care perspective and included direct non-health care costs such as OTC medicines.

The inclusion of an antibiotic trial (empirical treatment with one or more broad-spectrum antibiotics to exclude other infectious causes of pulmonary disease) is no longer part of the WHO diagnostic strategy for HIV-infected patients. However, in the clinics participating in the demonstration study from which the diagnostic performance parameters were sourced [2], an antibiotic trial was still commonly provided during the diagnostic process as an adjunct to the treatment of smear-negative individuals with suspected TB. Antibiotic trial was therefore included in the base
case; the model assumed that for each country the use of antibiotic
trial and chest X-ray was proportional to the observed use in the demonstration study clinics. In comparison, two alternative

The extent and type of cost-effectiveness gain from deploying Xpert is dependent on a number of different setting-specific factors. First and foremost of these factors is the performance of current TB diagnostic practice. Where the sensitivity of current practice is low, but specificity high, Xpert has a substantial impact on 
 effectiveness. Where the sensitivity of current practice is high, but specificity low, Xpert will lower treatment costs by reducing the number of false positives. This latter effect is illustrated by the case of Uganda, where the model predicts a reduction in the treatment costs of false positives from US$171,803 to US$14,908, contributing to the overall reduction in treatment costs.","Firstly, the assumption of no transmission effects or additional mortality benefit from early diagnosis is a conservative approach and will underestimate the cost-effectiveness of Xpert—particularly where the introduction of Xpert is likely to increase the numbers of drug-resistant patients who are appropriately and rapidly treated. Likewise, we do not
factor in patient costs. A full societal evaluation would make all options less cost-effective, but Xpert is likely to fare better than alternatives, as it requires fewer patient visits. In addition, if Xpert can achieve earlier diagnosis, substantial reductions in patient costs prior to treatment may be achieved. The reference standard for the test performance parameters in our model did not include culture-negative TB based on response to treatment, because this diagnostic category will include cases with no TB or extrapulmonary TB that cannot be diagnosed by sputum-based tests. This situation may have lead to overestimation of the sensitivity and underestimation of the specificity of Xpert. Owing to lack of evidence, we only included one repeat visit for false negatives in
our model, to capture those who quickly progress to smearpositive TB. This number may be insufficient and miss both the additional costs and effectiveness of further repeated visits. On the other hand, our assumption that 100% of false negatives still alive and with TB after 3 mo have a repeat visit may be an overestimation, thereby inflating ICERs for the Xpert scenarios. We assumed that a negative Xpert result does not lead to further TB diagnostic procedures. This assumption may not be true in practice, in particular not for HIV-infected individuals with
suspected TB. Our sensitivity analyses show that adding clinical diagnostic procedures for this group can substantially reduce cost-effectiveness of Xpert when HIV prevalence is high and X-ray is used extensively. Also because of the lack of data, we have not included a high MDR-TB, but low HIV-prevalence setting.
Finally, our sensitivity analysis demonstrates
that Xpert may not be cost-effective when compared to a base
case in which a high proportion of smear-negative TB cases are
diagnosed by culture. However, this result is based on our
assumption that culture performs at 100% sensitivity and
specificity. In addition, we did not include costs of specimen
transport, increased risk of false-negative cultures or contamination,
reduced sensitivity when only one specimen is cultured, and
possible delay effects on mortality and patient drop out. All these
simplifications will inflate the cost-effectiveness of a base case that
includes culture","In terms of priorities, suspect populations with a high likelihood of TB,
particularly in settings with high HIV and MDR-TB prevalence,
are an obvious choice. However, our findings illustrate that it is
also important to balance these factors with the current
performance of the existing diagnostic pathway. Countries or
areas that have the weakest performance in terms of diagnosing
smear-negative cases may benefit the most, even when they have
relatively low levels of MDR-TB and HIV; although additional
investment may be required to strengthen aspects of the health
system to ensure that Xpert can be implemented successfully.
Funding Xpert may also mean that scarce resources are not made
available to other equally deserving areas. Care must therefore be
exercised to take into account the broader tuberculosis control
and health system needs of any particular setting when funding
Xpert.","Also because of the lack of data, we have not included a high MDR-TB, but low HIV-prevalence setting.

associated with Xpert scale-up that we cannot predict at this point.

substantially increase TB diagnostic costs. Given this increase,

This conclusion is particularly
true for children aged 1 to <12 years, but is highly dependent on the prevalence of oseltamivir resistance in circulating influenza virus strains.","Our study did not address antiviral treatment strategies for hospitalized pediatric
patients or for infants aged <1 year old. Oseltamivir treatment of infants aged <1 year old with suspected or confirmed influenza was authorized in 2009-2010 for 2009 H1N1 by an emergency use authorization and is currently recommended
by the Advisory Committee on Immunication Practices and Centers for Disease Control for seasonal influenza. Our findings may not apply to all children with symptoms who have seasonal influenza because not all will manifest
common ILI symptoms, especially young children. We assumed that empiric oseltamivir treatment is initiated only in circumstances in which there is reasonable evidence of influenza virus infection on the basis of presenting clinical symptoms and the presence of influenza activity in the local community.

Our analysis conservatively limited the benefits of antiviral
treatment to those reported in clinical trial data. Other benefits from early oseltamivir treatment may include a reduced risk of pneumonia, hospitalization, or death on the basis of observational studies of oseltamivir treatment in children and adults. Our model also restricted the benefits of treatment to the direct recipient only and did not consider the indirect benefits of treatment, such as those potentially related to reduced virus transmission. Incorporating broader
treatment benefits in the analysis would make oseltamivir treatment more cost-effective, particularly in children who are at higher risk for influenza-related complications. Another limitation is that we only considered oseltamivir
resistance caused by the H275Y mutation in viral neuraminidase and did not consider other mutations that might confer reduced oseltamivir susceptibility or resistance. We also did not account for potential heterogeneity in the effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment across influenza virus types. We considered treatment benefits for children who were not vaccinated and children who were vaccinated separately and assumed that all children who were vaccinated had received inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine. Results for
children who are vaccinated may differ under alternative assumptions about vaccine form and effectiveness and the degree of antigenic match between circulating influenza virus and vaccine strains.

The treatment alternatives we evaluated in this study were chosen on the basis of treatment recommendations that may apply uniformly to children aged 1 to 17 years in the US, regardless of risk status. Zanamivir, an orally inhaled antiviral medication, currently is approved to treat influenza in children aged $7 years without underlying pulmonary conditions. We chose oseltamivir to analyze rather
than zanamivir because oseltamivir can be used more consistently to treat a wider pediatric age range in children with underlying pulmonary conditions and in children who cannot inhale a medication. Adamantanes were not chosen because currently they are not recommended because of widespread resistance among circulating influenza A viruses. We chose to only evaluate oseltamivir alone in an attempt to provide a clear take-away message from this
analysis. Not considering all possible alternatives may have biased the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios produced in the analysis.","These results differ from those reported in the earlier studies that examined the cost-effectiveness of antiviral treatment of influenza in children in the US.

The model structure (Figure 1) is defined by a set of core TB states, and these states are further subdivided to account for (1) aspects of HIV infection, progression, and treatment relevant to TB epidemiology; (2) multiple circulating TB strains, with different
drug resistance profiles; and (3) tracking of TB treatment history.
Core TB states. The core TB model simulates the movements
of individuals between states that capture important features
of TB transmission, natural history, and treatment. Individuals
enter the model in the susceptible state, where they face a risk of
TB infection. The risk of infection is modeled as a time-dependent
variable that reflects contact rates between infected and uninfected
individuals, and transmission probabilities that allow for varying
infectivity across different categories of active disease. Upon
infection, individuals progress either directly to active disease or to
latent infection. Individuals with latent infection may subsequently
progress to active TB or be superinfected by a different TB strain.
Active disease is categorized as smear-positive or smear-negative.
Smear-negative cases may progress to smear-positive, and all
individuals with active disease may spontaneously self-cure, which
returns them to the latent/recovered state. An individual with
active disease can be diagnosed as a TB case, according to the
characteristics of the diagnostic algorithm, and initiated on
treatment (as described in detail below). All individuals in the
model are subject to a background mortality rate and to TBrelated
mortality specific to each active disease state.
HIV subdivisions. HIV coinfection can alter the natural
history of TB, with HIV-infected individuals having a higher
probability of primary progressive TB upon initial infection
[42,43], a higher rate of breakdown from latent infection to active
TB [44], a lower probability of smear-positivity amongst those
with active disease [4–6], and higher mortality rates [4,45,46].
The HIV sub-model draws on model structure and key parameters
from an array of published HIV models [47–50]. Seven HIV
subdivisions were created, defined by CD4 cell count (.350 cells/
ml, 200–350 cells/ml, and ,200 cells/ml) and by whether or not an
individual is receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV incidence
is modeled as a transition from the HIV-negative category
to the HIV-positive, CD4 count .350 cells/ml category, with
time-varying incidence rates defined as exogenous model parameters.
HIV-positive individuals not on ART progress over time to
subdivisions with lower CD4 counts. Untreated individuals
transition onto ART at rates specific to their CD4 category.
These rates are allowed to vary over time to capture changing
eligibility criteria and coverage of testing and referral. HIV-related
mortality occurs at rates specific to each subdivision.
Drug resistance subdivisions. Model states are further
subdivided to account for differences in drug resistance among
circulating TB strains, including (1) pan-sensitive TB, (2) isoniazid
(INH) mono-resistant TB, (3) RIF mono-resistant TB, (4) TB
resistant to both INH and RIF (MDR-TB), and (5) TB resistant to
INH and RIF plus one or more second-line drugs (MDR+/XDRTB).
An individual in the susceptible state who is newly infected
with TB transitions to the subdivision of the infecting strain. An
individual with latent TB who is superinfected by a different strain
transitions to the subdivision of the superinfecting strain.
Individuals may also develop acquired drug resistance as a result of
TB treatment, transitioning to subdivisions with broader resistance
profiles.
Treatment history subdivisions. A final subdivision of
model states distinguishes treatment-naı¨ve from treatment-experienced
individuals, as diagnostic algorithms may dictate different
confirmatory tests depending on an individual’s history of prior
treatment. Individuals enter the model in the treatment-naı¨ve
subdivision, and all individuals exiting their first course of TB
treatment (through default, failure, or cure) transition to the
treatment-experienced subdivision.
The model is implemented as a series of difference equations
with a monthly time step. A full description of model structure and
equations is given in Text S1.",TRUE,TRUE,"The model allows individuals with pansensitive TB to develop mono-INH-resistant TB, mono-RIFresistant TB, or MDR-TB directly. Individuals with mono-INHormono-RIF-resistant TB can develop MDR-TB, and individuals with MDR-TB can develop MDR+/XDR-TB, with the rates of acquiring drug resistance dependent on a patient’s TB drug regimen and current drug resistance profile (see details in Text S1).","784 cost/DALY averted; 810 cost/life-year saved (Xpert $30, 20-y time horizon)","costs or savings /DALY, costs or savings /LYG","Deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA), Table of DSA, Tornado diagram of DSA, Three-way (or more) sensitivity analysis graph, Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve(s), uncertainty interval (2.5 and 97.5 percentiles)",One-way analyses: 1 SD; three-way: core probabilities are varied 20-80%,NA,Countries (five),"Along with the projected health benefits of scaling up Xpert will come significantly increased demands on healthcare resources. The large increase in funding required under the Xpert scenario raises the question of affordability. Although our cost-effectiveness results suggest that the introduction of Xpert represents good value for money according to typical international benchmarks, it does not automatically follow that TB program budgets will be able to
absorb these changes.","The application of any mathematical model of TB is inevitably limited by uncertainty regarding the true values of epidemiologic and programmatic
parameters. Our approach aims to reduce this parameter uncertainty through calibration, and to provide a valid quantitative expression of what parameter uncertainty remains based on Bayesian statistical inference; however, the uncertainty associated with model structure is impossible to quantify without building and assessing the whole range of possible model structures that might be adopted. For example, the results of this analysis would be different
if the interdependency of TB and HIV epidemics were not considered, or if the indirect effect of Xpert on TB transmission were not captured. It will therefore be important to undertake continued empirical research evaluating the impact of Xpert as it is rolled out in practice, with the information generated by these
evaluation efforts used to progressively refine the mathematical models used to estimate long-term intervention effects. 

In the results reported here, we constrained estimates on costs and health outcomes to account only for those that would accrue during either the first 10 y or the first 20 y following introduction of Xpert. While the choice of a limited time horizon acknowledges our increasing uncertainty about the distant future and reflects the immediacy of policy decisions, it also makes our results somewhat
conservative. This is particularly true for the 10-y results, which truncate the full streams of future benefits that will be enjoyed by those patients who avert TB mortality or infection during the 10-y analysis period. Likewise, we observe that cost-effectiveness ratios are more attractive over the 20-y horizon than the 10-y horizon, reflecting the compounding benefits of interrupting transmission
dynamics through better diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, the restriction of our study to adult populations will underestimate the total burden of disease that might be averted, with Xpert adoption likely to reduce pediatric TB through reduced exposure to actively infected adults as well as the direct application of the test for pediatric diagnosis.
","Whereas current debate about the costs of Xpert roll-out focuses largely on equipment and consumables connected directly to the assay, our results show that the indirect cost consequences associated with improved case-finding overshadow the direct costs of diagnosis. If current guidelines are followed, the adoption of Xpert places three key demands on a health system that are additional to the direct costs of diagnosis: providing first-line TB treatment to the large number of additional pan-sensitive TB cases that will be identified, providing additional HIV treatment to coinfected individuals who will live longer as a result of better TB care, and providing second-line TB treatment to the limited number of individuals diagnosed with drug-resistant TB. While our analysis accounts for all three demands, we recognize that response to each of these demands could be evaluated as a separate policy question. Such analyses are beyond the scope of our present study, but it is nevertheless important to note how the economics of Xpert are dependent on the additional interventions triggered by Xpert introduction—which are sensitive to both epidemiologic context and policy decisions. It is likely that existing resources and infrastructure will be called upon to support the introduction of Xpert and the cascade of complementary services this will trigger, and our findings underscore the concern raised by other commentators regarding the possible pitfalls of introducing Xpert into health systems that are already facing capacity constraints.

An important observation in this study is that substantial increases in HIV treatment costs are expected following introduction of Xpert. This critical insight has a large influence on the costeffectiveness of Xpert that would be missed in simpler models that do not capture the concurrent dynamics of TB and HIV, and is consistent with other analyses pointing to the importance of HIV and ART access for TB outcomes in this setting.","Finally, we note that the results of the present analysis emphasize the importance of interactions between TB and HIV epidemiology in settings where both are highly prevalent, but we caution against generalizing these results to regions where HIV rates are meaningfully different from those in southern Africa. Additional analyses are urgently needed to assess the consequences of introducing Xpert elsewhere, particularly regions of low HIV prevalence or with different TB drug resistance patterns. Similarly, this study focused on the relative benefits of the status quo algorithm and the Xpert algorithm suggested by WHO for diagnosis of patients with suspected TB in settings with high HIV burden. While this is an important comparison to make, there is abundant scope
for considering a wide array of alternatives, for example, considering different potential roles for sputum smear microscopy or chest X-ray within diagnostic algorithms designed around Xpert, or use of Xpert for different purposes, such as prior to provision of INH preventive therapy for individuals with HIV, or as part of active case-finding efforts",TRUE,NA,NA,NA,"The application of any mathematical model of TB is inevitably limited by uncertainty regarding the true values of epidemiologic and programmatic

Since the quality of care in the private sector may be low and patients commonly transition between private clinics, there is a higher risk of exposure to TB medications for insufficient durations with consequent lower cure rates and potential for MDR acquisition (Table 1).

PPM should be prioritized over GeneXpert, as private sector engagement is more cost-effective than GeneXpert alone and, if sufficient resources are available, would substantially increase the value of GeneXpert if both interventions are implemented together.

The combination of PPM and GeneXpert for all diagnosis including MDR diagnosis would have the additional benefit of reducing the prevalence of MDR TB, which is an important issue in ongoing epidemic control. PPM programs alone may not be able to significantly impact the MDR TB epidemic, as only GeneXpert strategies would be able to quickly provide DST and consequent strain-appropriate care -- GeneXpert used for initial diagnosis and DST at the outset of treatment may generate 15% declines in MDR TB prevalence over the next ten years (Figure 1).","This study has several limitations. Our model does not account for the fact that smear and Xpert preferentially diagnose the most infectious cases as it is unclear to what extent patient infectivity declines as more cases are diagnosed. It is unclear how and to what extent, assuming no change in overall infectivity, this would alter our results, as both PPM and GeneXpert interventions would diagnose relatively lower-infectivity patients. Our model also does not consider the impacts of other diseases and policies on India’s TB epidemic such as HIV or diabetes. However, including comorbidities in the analysis may imply that the strategies we identify are even more beneficial, if other diseases can be addressed incidentally as more individuals receive better healthcare and avoid the serious financial hardships accompanying TB. It is also important to recognize the relative scarcity of data on the TB epidemic in India, as our results rely on estimates of private and public clinic use, treatment effectiveness, and PPM program effectiveness from studies that may not be population representative. To mitigate this uncertainty, we perform extensive sensitivity analyses, which indicate that our results are generally robust. We also identify situations where one might prefer to implement technical innovations like GeneXpert without also implementing PPM health system programs.

If an incremental microbiologically confirmed TB diagnosis can lead to one year of additional life (or disability-adjusted life year averted), this willingness-to-pay threshold would be considered highly cost-effective by traditional criteria in most high-burden countries. However, in many settings, universal XpertMTB/RIF is not an affordable option[13], in part owing to recurring maintenance and calibration costs. In these cases, and when specimens can be processed at moderateto-
high volume, automated digital microscopy (with confirmation of positive results by Xpert) can improve the yield of manual microscopy, and at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio that is favorable relative to universal Xpert. The strategy that appears to optimize cost-effectiveness in most settings is Xpert confirmation of low-positive results only, taking high-positive results as a direct indication for treatment.","Parameter values were drawn from the literature and, in some cases, required assumptions based on expert opinion. Nevertheless, our results were robust to most sensitivity analyses, and particularly surrounding those parameter values that were most uncertain. We did not attempt to incorporate downstream effectiveness measures, including the health benefits of making TB diagnoses nor the costs and effectiveness of HIV therapy, which is a major driver of the economics of TB diagnosis in HIV-endemic settings. Our ability to compare automated microscopy to health interventions other than TB diagnostic assays is therefore limited. Nevertheless, we are able to demonstrate that the cost-effectiveness of automated microscopy is likely similar (if not superior) to that of Xpert MTB/RIF, which has been modeled in such fashion. We limited this analysis to the costs and consequences of microbiological diagnosis; in reality, ancillary diagnostic testing (e.g., with chest X-ray) and empiric treatment may have major impact on patient outcomes.

provides simultaneous screening for TB and RMP resistance. The use of Xpert for all presumptive TB cases contributed to the 13% increase in the number
of MDR-TB cases identified.

However,
although 2 Xperts are incrementally more sensitive than 1 Xpert, a requirement for 2 sputum samples would limit the benefits on turnaround time and cost.

A single-Xpert strategy was cost-saving in a variety of sensitivity analyses, suggesting that replacement of 3 AFB smears with Xpert to determine the need for AII would result in cost savings for most US hospitals. At HMC, assuming that 200 patients are admitted with presumptive tuberculosis annually, a
single unconcentrated Xpert testing strategy for AII could eliminate up to 10 304 hours of AII and save as many as $2 289 226 for HMC annually. Assuming that 100 smears are performed for every tuberculosis case detected in the United States and approximately 20% of presumptive tuberculosis cases are evaluated as inpatients, an Xpert-based testing strategy could save the national healthcare system up to 3 235 799 hours of AII and $718 893 272 annually, if the results from this study are extrapolated to other hospitals.","One limitation of this study is the hypothetical nature of the Xpert scenarios. The calculated impact of Xpert on AII duration was based on proxy measures because the test was not FDA-cleared to remove patients from AII at the time of
the study. Accordingly, we have conservatively estimated the potential impact of Xpert in reducing AII, although the laboratory processing time for Xpert is in fact shorter than that for AFB smears. The cost-savings from a 1-Xpert strategy on unconcentrated sputum may actually be underestimated rather than overestimated. Another limitation is the lack of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases, as no resistant isolates were detected during the study period. In high-burden settings, Xpert can dramatically reduce the time to diagnosis of drug-resistant PTB, although a rifampin-resistant result has a low PPV if the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis is low. A third limitation is the collection of base-case input data from a single institution and performance
of the CEA from an institutional perspective, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. However, the probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that a 1-Xpert strategy reduces costs across input ranges likely to encompass other US institutions. Given the institutional perspective, we did not consider other real-world benefits of Xpert outside the institution, such as reduced transmission, adverse events, or diminished patient satisfaction or mental health as consequences of AII.

$4500 per treatment initiation or $3800 per treatment completion among culture-positive patients. High test volume capacity at primary care clinics is probably
necessary for Xpert point-of-care placement to be economically feasible in many settings.","First, we did not account for rifampicin (RIF) resistance detection, a major
advantage of Xpert, in our analysis. The parent trial was not powered for detection of drug resistance, and the additional effectiveness gained by RIF resistance detection is not directly comparable to smear microscopy without incorporating another method of drug resistance testing, such as line probe assay, which was not performed in the study. Incorporation of RIF resistance detection might make Xpert more cost-effective by reducing the time to treatment in positive cases but might also favour smear microscopy because of the possibility for false-positive diagnosis of RIF resistance by Xpert. Second, our results are difficult to directly compare with those that used single utility metrics, such as DALYs.
However, we chose to compare costs using hard data and real-world clinical outcomes (obtained from several settings) rather than to estimate a measure (eg, DALYs), which requires extensive assumptions about the downstream consequences of a diverse array of clinical outcomes based on sparse data. We also did not attempt to estimate effects on secondary transmission for similar
reasons; thus, our findings, like for resistance detection, might be biased against point-of-care Xpert, which significantly shortened time to diagnosis in the trial.
Third, economic evaluation within the context of a clinical trial has inherent limitations. Although able to provide direct data in specific settings compared with
modelling, resource use and patient recruitment is often restricted to the selection criteria of the trial protocol. However, TB-NEAT was designed with pragmatic
implementation in mind, which might mitigate this concern to some degree, and empirical cost data was collected in a standardised way from multiple highburden
settings, which might not have been possible outside the context of a clinical trial. The cost of Lab Xpert used in our analysis (figure 1) was taken from the
National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) in South Africa but might be lower than if estimated with the use of empirically collected cost data. The NHLS Lab Xpert
cost estimate was chosen because it represents the cost charged to the South African government and thus represents the actual cost incurred from the health-care provider perspective. Several other studies have used this estimate for similar reasons. Finally, some limitations were also related to measurement uncertainty
of costs and outcomes. The large differences in incremental cost-effectiveness observed between the different study sites was primarily driven by differences in
effectiveness measures. However, these differences should be interpreted with caution because of the low recruitment number at any given site (eg, wide 95% CIs
were reported for patient outcomes in Tanzania) and that the TB-NEAT clinical trial was not powered to detect differences across the various study site.","In deciding whether point-of-care Xpert would be cost-effective, there is no consensus on appropriate willingness-to-pay thresholds, and the use of generic
thresholds have been largely criticised. Cost-effectiveness thresholds provide no information on affordability and do not have the disease-specific context in which

The use of Creactive protein and procalcitonin was deemed “good practice” in patients with suspected or confirmed serious bacterial infections, the use of chest X‐rays was deemed “good practice” in patients with
severe disease or with an atypical disease course, and the use of inhaled beta2 agonists and epinephrine was deemed “good practice” only if they were continued after a positive clinical response to a monitored trial.

Results were robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.","First, the severity of bronchiolitis instead of the utilization of the “good practice” or lack thereof in the diagnosis and management of the disease could have been the main determinant of both the outcome and the costs for each of the two comparators of the model.

Briefly, the simulation model was calibrated to 2017 WHO estimates of TB incidence, prevalence, and mortality in India using a stepwise procedure (see Additional file 1: Section S2.5). At the end of the calibration period, we modeled the introduction of Xpert in area(s) where Xpert testing is not available, as a first-line test replacing on-site SSM, under decentralized and centralized testing scenarios as described above. The
model was then run for 10 years to project corresponding changes in the incidence and mortality of DS- and DR-TB. The core model simulates a population of one
million people, representative of an average-sized district in India that might contain a single DTC [25]. For each Xpert testing scenario (centralized versus decentralized), we generated 2000 independent simulations of TB transmission
at the district level. To assess the policy implementations at a city or state level, we then constructed larger simulated populations of 20 million people by combining 20 randomly sampled districts (with replacement) from the original pool of simulations.

scale simulations with a population of 20 million individuals each. All outcomes were reported as median values with interquartile uncertainty ranges across these

three important factors: the testing volume at decentralized facilities and centralized facilities (i.e., how many decentralized facilities are referring), the degree to which costs of specimen transport can be shared with other
non-TB disease entities, and the level of pre-treatment LTFU caused by the delays in centralized testing. Provided that decentralized testing can be performed with equal quality as centralized testing, the costs and LTFU incurred by using a hub-and-spoke system are likely to justify the increased costs of decentralized testing in most scenarios, except in settings where testing volumes in the periphery
remain very low (mean < 1 test per day).","As with any modeling exercise, our study has certain limitations. We adopted a number of simplifying assumptions, including homogeneous mixing, representation of India’s TB diagnostic landscape as having only three tiers (informal, formal private, and public), and representation of the diagnostic process as occurring within a discrete number of specific encounters. To the extent that these simplifications depart from the complex reality of TB transmission and diagnosis in the Indian healthcare system, we may over- or underestimate
the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of decentralized testing. The most important assumptions in this model are the degree to which decentralized
Xpert testing will reduce those who will be permanently lost in the TB care cascade (pre-treatment LTFU, relative to centralized testing) and the degree to which patients will return for follow-up evaluation. Given the complexity of the TB care cascade and patient care-seeking behaviors, implementation of decentralized testing alone may not achieve substantive reductions in LTFU. We also did not consider costs of implementing programmatic interventions that may be necessary to translate peripheral testing into reductions in LTFU; where such interventions are required (or where LTFU is already low, even with centralized testing), the cost-effectiveness of decentralized Xpert may be much less favorable than projected here. Nevertheless, we estimated that decentralized testing could be implemented
at a lower unit cost than centralized testing in many situations—and to the extent that this can be accomplished (without a loss in quality), decentralized testing is likely to be preferred. Finally, we assumed, for the purpose of comparison, a setting
in which Xpert was scaled up as a first-line test for TB among all adults with symptoms; cost-effectiveness of Xpert overall (and of decentralized Xpert relative
to centralized Xpert) may be improved by adoption of other algorithms, such as focusing on high-priority populations.",NA,NA,TRUE,NA,2000; 6000 /DALY,NA,NA,Charity,TRUE,Kapoor 2012,Tuberculosis,India,NA,US dollars,Cost Effectiveness analysis,Cost Utility Analysis,NA,NA,NA,10,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,tuberculosis,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,10 years,FALSE,TRUE,Tuberculosis,dynamic model,>= 5 years,Other,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Other,DALY,Not reported/missing,Unclear/not reported,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Lower middle income,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
